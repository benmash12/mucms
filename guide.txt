INSTALLATION STEPS

1.  Export "mucms.zip" and load it into an IDE, preferably Oracle 
    Netbeans 8.2. Then also load the jar files from the libraries
    folder into the project. Prefer to use JDK 1.8 and Glassfish 
    server 4.1.1
2.  Create a MySQl database (name preferred is "mucms") and import
    mucms.sql into it. Then also run the mysql server to enable
    connection when running the apllication.
3.  Open [project_root]/web/server.jsp and edit the contents of the first
    JSP declaration tag when necessary. The first one which is the 
    "project_root" is necessary to enable the export to pdf feature.
4.  Run the project which will take you to the welcome page where you can
    register, login, or view info. Please take note of the constraints
    displayed when registering or logging in. Also note that you can log in
    as user or as admin from the same window, password is case sensitive and
    username might be case sensitive.
5   You can explore the application as you wish afterwards.

PROJECT LIMITATIONS

1.  When exporting to pdf, it might be noticed that previously exported pdf files
    are still saved in the pdf directory even when they are not needed anymore, 
    this results into unnecesary use of space. This challenge will be handled 
    on a production server through the use of routine cron jobs to periodically
    delete previously exported pdf files after one hour.
2.  During development, redeploying project without first shutting down the 
    glassfish server corrupts the session variables which the SPA (Single Page
    Application) depends on to load its content. Please always shutdown 
    glassfish/tomcat server before rebuilding and redeploying the project.
